= Literature Survey

#citet("Wei2024Brittleness") introduce low-rank decomposition methods designed
to identify specific ranks within a weight matrix related to given LLM
behaviors. Their ActSVD algorithm performs Singular Value Decomposition on the
product of the model weights and input activations ($W X_"in"$), and yields an
orthogonal projection matrix ($Pi$).

Removing the top safety-critical ranks ActSVD identifies causes the model to
completely stop rejecting unsafe prompts, and the model's utility is severely
compromised. These findings suggest that safety regions in aligned models are
also crucial for its general utility. To disentangle safety from utility, the
authors remove safety ranks orthogonal to utility ranks using
$Delta W = (I - Pi^u) Pi^s W$. This yields higher attack success rate for unsafe
prompts while maintaining zero-shot accuracy for utility prompts.

The fact that naively ablating safety ranks destroys utility, whereas
surgically removing disentangled ranks preserves it, indicates that top safety
ranks and top utility ranks heavily overlap. The necessity of this orthogonal
projection matrix provides strong evidence against the hypothesis of strict
linear separability between safety and utility. Ultimately, ActSVD provides
rank-level evidence for superposition: safety and utility share representational
capacity and are not linearly distinct.

#citet("pmlr-v267-wollschlager25a") generalize the identification of safety
subspaces to conic regions of multiple basis refusal vectors as opposed to one
refusal direction. Instead of testing pairs of harmful and harmless prompts,
their methods of Refusal Direction Optimization and Refusal Cone Optimization
perform gradient descent to converge on refusal vector direction(s). They
leverage two properties of ideal refusal vectors in loss functions for
optimization:

- Given a refusal direction $r$, scalar $alpha$, initial activation $x_i$, and
  revised activation $caron(x)_i = x_i + alpha dot r$, refusal probability
  should scale with $alpha$.
- Removing the refusal direction should not affect harmless prompts while
  allowing response to harmful prompts.

This research finds significant jailbreaking performance gains using one refusal
direction, with further gains up to a four-dimensional refusal region. Testing
on Gemma-2, Llama 3, and Qwen 2.5 model families and benchmarks such as
TruthfulQA, ablation of multiple refusal vectors is shown to have better attack
success and lower side-effects on model performance.

Furthermore, noting that vector orthogonality does not guarantee causal
independence, the research defines a notion of representational independence
between vectors, in which the ablation of one direction does not impact the
effects of the other. Ablating three or more representationally independent
refusal vectors is found to have higher attack success than difference-of-means
direction ablation. This further shows that safety and utility occupy a complex
subspace within LLMs.
